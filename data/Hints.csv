What can you change to make a drake with {{trait}}?","Your drake still has no {{trait}}! To make a drake with {{trait}}, you need at least one ""{{trait}}"" allele. Set one allele to ""{{trait}}"" and see what happens!"

If a drake has at least one dominant allele for {{trait}}, it will always have {{trait}}.","For a drake to not have {{trait}}, it needs two recessive alleles. Look at the {{trait}} alleles. What can you change to make a drake not have {{trait}}?","Your drake still has {{trait}}! To make a drake without {{trait}}, you need two ""not {{trait}}"" alleles. Set both alleles to ""not {{trait}}"" and see what happens!"
